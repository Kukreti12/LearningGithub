Every enterprise is powered by data. We take information in, analyze it, manipulate it,
and create more as output. Every application creates data, whether it is log messages,
metrics, user activity, outgoing messages, or something else. Every byte of data has a
story to tell, something of importance that will inform the next thing to be done. In
order to know what that is, we need to get the data from where it is created to where
it can be analyzed. We see this every day on websites like Amazon, where our clicks
on items of interest to us are turned into recommendations that are shown to us a
little later.
